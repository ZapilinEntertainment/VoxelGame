[01]We decided that our population will be our stability. Our people are many, and united we stand tall. So lets transform our small home into a powerful country!
[02]For owning our own lands we will need a lot of resources, workpower and transport mechanisms. At first we need an
[03]. This massive construction needs a very powerful energy source with a 3x3 free space and shall be built at the bottom side of the island.
[04]Build
[05]. Make attention that it needs a lot of energy supply. Also its workspeed will be in dependency of excess energy reserves. Be sure that you have got well-prepared power base.
[06]Now continue supplying the Anchor with power.
[07]thousands of energy to start anchoring your island!
[08]Collect
[09] energy and then press "
[10]" button to start anchoring.
[15]Anchor enabled, start charging!
[11]Now when the anchor is stable we have to finish first inner ring to support further construction. Note again, that lift speed will be affected by excess power supply - up to
[12]Inner ring construction
[13]Construct inner platforms ring before further expansion. Track objectives on right panel and build new sectors when possible.
[14]Sectors built
[16]First ring completed! Now we can start the colonization process in full power. Before creating new sectors be sure than you can place thousands of colonists and supply them - you will need much residential areas and huge amount of food with full-prepared healthcare institution.
[17]Wait until passenger pier will stand in position.
[18]New pier is ready to access. Press the "ready" button to start colonization!
